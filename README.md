# AI-Based-Workforce-Productivity-Wellbeing-Analytics:
Healthcare and public sector organizations across Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
and Finland are facing staff shortages, burnout, and low morale due to
increased service demands and aging populations.
Traditional HR systems record attendance, shifts, and sick leaves, but they don’t
provide early warning signals when teams are under stress or when workloads
are imbalanced.
Burnout leads to high absenteeism, poor service quality, and rising recruitment
costs — especially in hospitals, social welfare services, and citizen service
canters.
Managers lack visibility into factors driving performance decline, and employees
often report stress too late.
There is a pressing need for a system that can continuously monitor workforce
well-being indicators, detect early signs of burnout, and recommend proactive
measures to improve productivity and morale.
